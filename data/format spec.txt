Each row in the input file gets converted to an entry in the output file.

The structure of the output file is one 32 bit unsigned int containing the number of entries in the 
file fillowed y the entries.

Each entry is as follows:
14 total bytes:
each field is an unsigned int of the specified length
4 bytes: time (ns since the first entry)
4 bytes: user num
1 byte: red
1 byte: green
1 byte: blue
3 bytes: x,y coords (packing format below)

coordinate packing:
24 bit (3 byte), number with bits 0-10 representing the y coordinate, 
and bits 11-21 representing x
See converter.cpp for the code that does the conversion
